# hlo
HLO: Half-kernel Laplacian Operator for Surface Smoothing

### Usage

Directly use the 'HLO.exe' file.


put the noisy mesh file under the same folder (e.g., bunny.off, supported format: obj, off, stl, wrl, ply, mesh)


run: 

```
HLO.exe bunny.off 5
```

'bunny.off' is the input mesh, 5 is the number of vertex update iteration.
You will see the denoised mesh name by 'xxx_denoised.obj' inside the same folder. 


The code will be released soon
